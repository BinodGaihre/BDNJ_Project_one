# Foreign Language Movies Analysis

## Project Overview
#This project analyzes data from TMDB (The Movie Database) to uncover insights about the languages of movies. 
#Of the 4,042 movies listed, the project examines the most common languages for non-English films, 
#their audience ratings, and the top-rated films in each language based on average score.

## Key Findings
#1. Most Common Movie Languages in dataset:
#    - English: 3,821 movies
#    - French: 45 movies
#    - Spanish: 27 movies
#    - Chinese: 20 movies
#    - German  : 20 movies

# 2.   Average Audience Ratings (Scale: 1-10):
#    -   Spanish: 6.6
#    -   German: 6.4
#    -   French: 6.3
#    -   Chinese: 6.1

# 3.   Top-Rated Movies by Language (Minimum 1,000 Votes):
#    -   English: The Shawshank Redemption , directed by Frank Darabont, Drama, 8.5/10 (1994)

#    -   Spanish: Pan’s Labyrinth , directed by Guillermo del Toro, Fantasy, 7.6/10 (2006)

## Limitations
# - Many movies had very few votes, making it difficult to compare ratings accurately across languages. 
#To address this, only movies with at least 1,000 votes were included in the analysis of top-rated films.

## Data Analysis Steps
# 1.   Top Languages : Identify the most common languages using `value_counts()`.
# 2.   Visualize Language Popularity: Create a bar chart showing the number of movies for the top 
# four foreign languages (French, Spanish, Chinese, German).
# 3.   Average Ratings: Compute average audience ratings by language and visualize them using a bar chart.
# 4.   Top-Rated Movies:
#    - Filter movies with at least 1,000 votes.
#    - Identify the top-rated movie in each language.
#    - Extract relevant details: title, director, genre, and rating.
# 5.   Export Results:
#    - Display the data as a table.

## Results Table
# A table summarizing top-rated movies by language includes columns for:
# - Title
